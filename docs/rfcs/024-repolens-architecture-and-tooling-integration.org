- Authors: SRE Team & Code Architect
- Status: DRAFT
- Created: [2024-09-15 Sun]

* Abstract

This RFC proposes a comprehensive architecture and tooling integration strategy for the RepoLens project, building upon and expanding the tooling and workflow recommendations from RFC 005. It addresses the high-level system design, infrastructure considerations, and development workflow improvements. The proposal aims to create a scalable, maintainable, and efficient system while streamlining the development process through integrated tooling.


* Current State and Problem Statement

RepoLens is a growing project that analyzes and provides insights into code repositories. As the project scales, we face several challenges:

1. Lack of a well-defined, scalable architecture
2. Inconsistent development environments across the team
3. Manual and error-prone deployment processes
4. Insufficient observability and monitoring
5. Fragmented tooling for project management and development

These issues can lead to reduced productivity, increased technical debt, and difficulties in maintaining and scaling the system as it grows.

* Proposed Solution

We propose a comprehensive solution that addresses both the architectural needs and tooling integration for RepoLens:

** High-Level Architecture

** Component Descriptions

1. API Gateway: Handles routing and load balancing of incoming requests
2. Authentication Service: Manages user authentication and authorization
3. Repository Analysis Service: Processes and analyzes code repositories
4. Insights Generation Service: Generates insights based on repository analysis
5. User Management Service: Handles user-related operations
6. Background Jobs: Manages long-running tasks and scheduled operations
7. Monitoring & Logging: Provides observability across all services

** Technology Stack Recommendations

- Language: Python 3.9+
- Web Framework: FastAPI
- Database: PostgreSQL for relational data, MongoDB for document storage
- Caching: Redis
- Message Queue: RabbitMQ
- Container Orchestration: Kubernetes
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Monitoring: Prometheus & Grafana
- Logging: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)

** Development Tooling Integration

1. Project Management: Make
2. Dependency Management: Poetry
3. Code Style and Linting: Black, isort, flake8
4. Testing: pytest
5. Documentation: Sphinx with Read the Docs theme
6. API Documentation: OpenAPI (Swagger)
7. Version Control: Git with GitHub
8. RFC Management: Emacs org-mode with org-roam (as per RFC 023)

* Rationale for Key Decisions

1. Microservices Architecture: Allows for independent scaling and development of components.
2. FastAPI: Provides high performance, easy API documentation, and type checking.
3. PostgreSQL & MongoDB: Combination allows flexibility for different data models.
4. Kubernetes: Offers robust container orchestration for microservices.
5. Poetry: Provides deterministic builds and easier dependency management compared to pip.
6. Make: Simplifies common development tasks and provides a consistent interface.
7. GitHub Actions: Tightly integrates with our version control system for CI/CD.

* Benefits

1. Scalability: Microservices architecture allows independent scaling of components.
2. Maintainability: Clear separation of concerns and modular design.
3. Developer Productivity: Integrated tooling and consistent environments.
4. Observability: Built-in monitoring and logging across services.
5. Deployment Efficiency: Automated CI/CD pipeline for faster and safer deployments.
6. Code Quality: Enforced through linting, formatting, and testing in the development workflow.

* Drawbacks and Risks

1. Complexity: Microservices introduce operational complexity.
2. Learning Curve: Team needs to adapt to new tools and workflows.
3. Initial Setup Time: Significant effort required for initial architecture implementation.

* Alternatives Considered

1. Monolithic Architecture: Rejected due to scalability and maintainability concerns.
2. Django instead of FastAPI: Rejected due to performance requirements and API-first approach.
3. Docker Compose for orchestration: Rejected due to limited scalability compared to Kubernetes.

* Open Questions

1. How do we handle data migration and schema evolution in our databases?
2. What is our strategy for API versioning as the project evolves?
3. How do we implement effective error handling and resilience across microservices?

* Implementation Phases

1. Set up basic project structure and tooling (2 weeks)
2. Implement core services: API Gateway, Auth, User Management (4 weeks)
3. Develop Repository Analysis and Insights Generation services (6 weeks)
4. Set up Kubernetes infrastructure and CI/CD pipeline (3 weeks)
5. Implement monitoring and logging solutions (2 weeks)
6. Conduct security audit and penetration testing (2 weeks)
7. Perform load testing and optimization (2 weeks)
8. Document architecture and APIs (Ongoing)

* Conclusion

This RFC proposes a comprehensive architecture and tooling integration for RepoLens that addresses current limitations and sets the foundation for future growth. By adopting a microservices architecture, implementing robust tooling, and following DevOps best practices, we can create a scalable, maintainable, and efficient system. The proposed solution balances developer productivity with system performance and provides a clear path for project evolution.
