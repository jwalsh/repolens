* Abstract
This RFC proposes a simplified team structure for the CodeNexus project, reducing the number of specialized roles to improve efficiency and focus on core functionality. The new structure aims to streamline development processes and enhance collaboration among team members.

* Motivation
The current team structure, as outlined in previous RFCs, is potentially overcomplicated for the core goals of CodeNexus. By simplifying the team structure, we can:
1. Reduce communication overhead
2. Focus on essential features
3. Accelerate development and decision-making processes
4. Improve overall project efficiency

* Proposal
We propose to simplify the team structure to the following roles:

#+BEGIN_SRC json :tangle ../src/team_structure.json
{
  "project": "CodeNexus",
  "agents": [
    {
      "role": "Project Coordinator",
      "id": "coordinator",
      "responsibilities": [
        "Facilitate communication",
        "Project planning and task prioritization",
        "Ensure focus on core functionality",
        "Simplify complex ideas",
        "Align team with project objectives"
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "Core Developer",
      "id": "core_dev",
      "responsibilities": [
        "Implement essential features",
        "Develop file traversal and analysis logic",
        "Create basic output formats",
        "Implement CLI using Click or Typer"
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "Code Reviewer / QA",
      "id": "code_reviewer",
      "responsibilities": [
        "Review code submissions",
        "Ensure code quality and best practices",
        "Perform testing and quality checks",
        "Assist with documentation"
      ]
    },
    {
      "role": "Package Manager / Documentation",
      "id": "pkg_doc_manager",
      "responsibilities": [
        "Prepare project for PyPI distribution",
        "Manage dependencies and versioning",
        "Create and maintain documentation",
        "Ensure smooth installation process"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "communicationChannels": [
    "chat",
    "code_review",
    "video"
  ],
  "coreObjectives": [
    "Develop simplified project repository analysis tool",
    "Focus on essential features",
    "Ensure code quality and maintainability",
    "Provide clear documentation",
    "Distribute as PyPI package"
  ]
}

* Implementation Plan
1. Update project documentation to reflect the new team structure
2. Reassign tasks and responsibilities based on the simplified roles
3. Adjust communication channels and meetings to align with the new structure
4. Review and update existing RFCs that may be affected by this change
5. Implement a brief transition period to allow team members to adapt to their new roles

* Drawbacks
1. Potential loss of specialized expertise in certain areas
2. Increased workload for some team members due to combined responsibilities
3. Possible need for additional training or skill development

* Alternatives
1. Maintain the current team structure with minor adjustments
2. Implement a rotating role system where team members switch responsibilities periodically
3. Adopt a completely flat structure with no defined roles

* Open Questions
1. How will this simplified structure affect the project timeline?
2. Are there any specific skills or expertise we need to prioritize in our hiring or training processes?
3. How can we ensure that all necessary tasks are covered with fewer specialized roles?

* Conclusion
The proposed simplified team structure for CodeNexus aims to streamline our development process and focus on core functionality. By reducing the number of specialized roles, we can improve communication, accelerate decision-making, and maintain a clear focus on our project objectives. This structure aligns with our goal of creating an efficient, user-friendly repository analysis tool while ensuring high code quality and comprehensive documentation.
