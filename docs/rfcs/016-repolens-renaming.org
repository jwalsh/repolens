* Abstract

This RFC proposes renaming the CodeNexus project to RepoLens. The change will involve updating all references to the project name throughout the codebase, documentation, and related materials.

* Motivation

The decision to rename the project from CodeNexus to RepoLens has been made to better reflect the project's focus on repository analysis and insights. This change aims to improve brand clarity and align the project name more closely with its core functionality.

* Specification

** Scope of Changes

The renaming process will affect the following areas:

1. Source code (Python files, class names, variables)
2. HTML templates
3. Static assets (CSS, JavaScript)
4. Documentation (RFCs, user guides, API docs)
5. Configuration files (setup.py, pyproject.toml)
6. CI/CD pipeline configurations
7. Project metadata (README, package info)
8. External references and URLs

** Implementation Plan

1. Create a new git branch: ~feature/rename-to-repolens~
2. Update core Python files:
   - Rename the main package from ~codenexus~ to ~repolens~
   - Update all import statements
   - Modify class names, function names, and variables as needed
3. Update HTML templates:
   - Replace all occurrences of "CodeNexus" with "RepoLens"
   - Update any CSS classes or IDs that include the project name
4. Modify static assets:
   - Update any project name references in CSS and JavaScript files
   - Rename any asset files that include "codenexus" in their name
5. Update documentation:
   - Revise all RFCs, including this one, to reflect the new project name
   - Update user guides and API documentation
   - Modify any code examples in the documentation
6. Adjust configuration files:
   - Update setup.py, pyproject.toml, and any other build or configuration files
   - Modify CI/CD pipeline configurations (e.g., .github/workflows files)
7. Update project metadata:
   - Revise README.md with the new project name and any necessary changes
   - Update package information for distribution (e.g., PyPI metadata)
8. Search for and update any remaining references:
   - Use grep or similar tools to find any missed occurrences
   - Pay special attention to comments and docstrings
9. Update external references:
   - Modify any project URLs or repository names
   - Update references in external documentation or websites

*** Search for Instances of Old Project Name
#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results output :exports both
echo "Searching for 'CodeNexus'..."
grep -R "CodeNexus" .
echo "\nSearching for 'codenexus'..."
grep -R "codenexus" .
echo "\nSearching for 'code-nexus'..."
grep -R "code-nexus" .
#+END_SRC

*** Example Python File Renaming
#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle test_repolens_core.py :exports both
# Old import
# from codenexus.utils import analyze_repo

# New import
from repolens.utils import analyze_repo

class RepoLensAnalyzer:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "RepoLens Analyzer"
    
    def analyze(self, repo_url):
        return analyze_repo(repo_url)

# Test the change
analyzer = RepoLensAnalyzer()
print(analyzer.name)
#+END_SRC

** Testing and Validation

1. Run all existing unit and integration tests
2. Perform manual testing of all major functionalities
3. Verify that all documentation is accurate and consistent
4. Test the build and deployment processes

*** Example Test Case
#+BEGIN_SRC python :exports both
def test_analyzer_name():
    analyzer = RepoLensAnalyzer()
    assert analyzer.name == "RepoLens Analyzer", f"Expected 'RepoLens Analyzer', got '{analyzer.name}'"

test_analyzer_name()
print("Test passed successfully.")
#+END_SRC

** Rollout Plan

1. Create a pull request with all changes
2. Conduct a thorough code review
3. Merge the changes to the main branch
4. Create a new release with the updated project name
5. Deploy the changes to staging for final verification
6. Deploy to production

* Advantages

1. Improved brand clarity and alignment with project functionality
2. Opportunity to review and refactor code during the renaming process
3. Increased visibility and searchability with a more distinctive name

* Disadvantages

1. Temporary confusion for existing users and contributors
2. Risk of breaking changes if any references are missed
3. Time investment required for the renaming process

* Alternatives Considered

1. Keeping the current name "CodeNexus"
2. Choosing a different name that still includes "Code" (e.g., CodeLens)
3. Adopting a completely unrelated name

* Open Questions

1. Should we implement URL redirects for any existing external links?
2. How do we handle archived data or logs that may contain the old project name?
3. Is there a need for a transitional period where both names are recognized?

* Required Resources

1. Developer time for implementing changes and testing
2. Review time from team members
3. Updates to any external services or integrations using the project name

* Success Criteria

1. All occurrences of "CodeNexus" successfully replaced with "RepoLens"
2. All tests passing after the renaming
3. Documentation fully updated and consistent
4. Successful deployment with no issues related to the name change
5. Positive feedback from team members and early users on the new name

* Timeline

| Day | Task                                            |
|-----+-------------------------------------------------|
| 1-2 | Initial code changes and documentation updates  |
|   3 | Internal review and testing                     |
|   4 | Address feedback and perform final checks       |
|   5 | Create pull request and conduct code review     |
|   6 | Merge changes and create new release            |
|   7 | Deploy to production and monitor for any issues |

* Conclusion

Renaming the project from CodeNexus to RepoLens is a significant change that will improve the project's branding and clarity. While it requires careful implementation and thorough testing, the benefits of a more appropriate and distinctive name outweigh the temporary inconvenience of the transition.
