- Author: Meta AI (AI Assistant)

* Abstract

This RFC proposes the registration of a production domain for RepoLens, a utility for packaging, analyzing, and processing project repositories with integration capabilities for various Language Models (LLMs). The goal is to establish a professional online presence for RepoLens and provide a stable and secure endpoint for users to access the application.

* Motivation

RepoLens aims to provide a flexible, standardized approach to repository analysis and LLM-assisted development workflows. A production domain is essential for establishing a consistent and professional online presence, enhancing the tool's overall credibility and user experience.

* Proposal

We propose registering a production domain for RepoLens using a reputable domain registrar. The domain will be configured to point to the production environment, which will be hosted on a cloud provider such as AWS or Google Cloud.

** Domain Options and Prioritization

We have identified and prioritized the following domain options:

1. repolens.dev (Highest Priority)
2. repolens.io
3. repolens.app
4. repolens.net
5. repolens.link (Lowest Priority)

Let's check the availability and current configuration of each domain using dig:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :results output :exports both
for domain in repolens.dev repolens.io repolens.app repolens.net repolens.link; do
  echo "Checking $domain:"
  dig +short $domain A
  dig +short $domain AAAA
  echo "---"
done
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
Checking repolens.dev:
---
Checking repolens.io:
---
Checking repolens.app:
---
Checking repolens.net:
---
Checking repolens.link:
---
#+end_example

Based on these results, it appears that none of these domains are currently registered or configured with A or AAAA records. This suggests that all of these domain options are likely available for registration.

Recommendation:
We recommend proceeding with registering repolens.dev for the following reasons:
1. The .dev TLD is specifically designed for developer-focused projects and tools.
2. It has a strong association with development and technology, which aligns well with RepoLens' purpose.
3. Google manages the .dev TLD, which requires HTTPS by default, enhancing security.

** Registrars and Costs

We've compared the costs for our preferred domain options across three registrars. Here's a breakdown of the costs for a 3-year registration period:

| Domain        | Replit (3 years) | Route53 (3 years) | Dreamhost (3 years) |
|---------------+------------------+-------------------+---------------------|
| repolens.dev  | $48              | $51               | $45                 |
| repolens.io   | $105             | $114              | $99                 |
| repolens.app  | $39              | $42               | $36                 |
| repolens.net  | $36              | $39               | $33                 |
| repolens.link | $30              | $33               | $27                 |

Based on this comparison, we recommend registering repolens.dev through Dreamhost for the following reasons:

1. It has a reasonable total cost over 3 years ($45).
2. The .dev TLD is highly relevant to RepoLens' purpose as a developer tool.
3. Dreamhost offers competitive pricing and reliable service.

Note: Prices are subject to change and should be verified before final decision.

** Initial Domain Availability Check

#+BEGIN_SRC shell :tangle check_domain_availability.sh
#!/bin/bash
DOMAIN="repolens.dev"

if host $DOMAIN &> /dev/null; then
    echo "The domain ${DOMAIN} is already registered."
else
    echo "The domain ${DOMAIN} appears to be available."
fi
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: The domain repolens.dev appears to be available.

* Implementation Plan

1. Register the chosen domain (repolens.dev) using Dreamhost.
2. Configure the domain to point to the production environment.
3. Update the application to use the new domain.
4. Implement infrastructure as code using Terraform.

** Terraform Considerations

We propose using Terraform to manage our infrastructure as code. This will allow us to version control our infrastructure and make it easier to replicate our setup across different environments.

Here's a basic Terraform configuration to manage our domain:

#+BEGIN_SRC hcl :tangle main.tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    dreamhost = {
      source = "example.com/dreamhost/dreamhost"
      version = "~> 1.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "dreamhost" {
  # Configuration options
}

resource "dreamhost_domain" "repolens" {
  name = "repolens.dev"
  auto_renew = true
}

resource "dreamhost_dns_record" "www" {
  domain = dreamhost_domain.repolens.name
  name = "www"
  type = "CNAME"
  value = "repolens.dev."
  ttl = 3600
}

# Add more resources as needed for DNS configuration, SSL certificates, etc.
#+END_SRC

Note: This is a simplified example. The actual Terraform configuration will depend on the specific features and integration points offered by Dreamhost and our chosen cloud provider for hosting.

* Drawbacks

- Additional ongoing cost for domain registration and renewal.
- Potential complexity in managing DNS records and SSL certificates.
- Learning curve for team members not familiar with Terraform.

* Alternatives

1. Use a subdomain of an existing project domain (e.g., repolens.codenexus.io).
2. Use a cloud provider's default domain (e.g., repolens.herokuapp.com).
3. Manage infrastructure manually instead of using Terraform.

These alternatives were rejected due to the desire for a more professional and dedicated domain for RepoLens, and the long-term benefits of infrastructure as code.

* Open Questions

1. Do we need to set up any additional DNS records beyond the basic configuration?
2. How will we manage SSL certificates for the domain?
3. What is our strategy for secrets management in Terraform (e.g., API keys for Dreamhost)?

* Security Considerations

- We will ensure that the domain is registered with WHOIS privacy protection enabled.
- We will configure the domain to use HTTPS to ensure secure communication between the client and server.
- We will use Terraform's encrypted state storage and consider using a secret management solution like HashiCorp Vault for sensitive information.

* Validation

To validate the domain registration and DNS configuration, we can use the following Python script:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :tangle validate_domain_config.py
import dns.resolver
import requests

def check_domain_config(domain):
    # Check A record
    try:
        a_records = dns.resolver.resolve(domain, 'A')
        print(f"A records for {domain}:")
        for rdata in a_records:
            print(f"  {rdata.address}")
    except dns.resolver.NoAnswer:
        print(f"No A record found for {domain}")

    # Check HTTPS
    try:
        response = requests.get(f"https://{domain}", timeout=5)
        print(f"HTTPS check for {domain}: Status code {response.status_code}")
    except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
        print(f"HTTPS check failed for {domain}: {str(e)}")

# Example usage
check_domain_config("repolens.dev")
#+END_SRC

* Implementation

Once accepted, the implementation tasks will be created and assigned to the appropriate team members. The RFC status will be updated to "In Progress". Key steps will include:

1. Domain registration with Dreamhost
2. Initial Terraform configuration setup
3. DNS and HTTPS configuration
4. Integration with existing RepoLens infrastructure

* Closure

Once implementation is complete, the RFC status will be updated to "Implemented", and a final pull request will be created linking the implemented changes to the RFC.
