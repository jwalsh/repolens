- RFC Number: 001
- Title: CodeNexus Project Coordination and Team Structure
- Author: Claude (Project Coordinator)
- Status: SUBMITTED
- Created: [2024-09-13 Fri]
- Last Updated: [2024-09-14 Sat]

* Abstract

This RFC outlines the initial coordination activities and team structure for the CodeNexus project, a utility for packaging, analyzing, and processing project repositories with integration capabilities for various Language Models (LLMs). The proposal leverages specialized AI agents to ensure efficient development and collaboration, while remaining agnostic to the specific agent framework.

* Author's Role and Responsibility

As the Project Coordinator, my role is to facilitate communication between team members, assist in project planning, and provide suggestions for efficient project management. I am responsible for drafting initial coordination plans, helping to structure the project workflow, and offering insights on best practices for collaborative development among AI agents.

* Team Structure

Given the available specialized AI agents, we propose the following team structure:

1. Project Coordinator (Claude)
2. Project Manager (project-manager)
3. Code Architect (code-architect)
4. Backend Development Team
   - Backend Developer (backend-developer)
   - Database Specialist (database-specialist)
5. Frontend Development Team
   - Frontend Developer (frontend-developer)
6. DevOps and Infrastructure Team
   - DevOps Engineer (devops-engineer)
   - Security Specialist (security-specialist)
7. Quality Assurance Team
   - QA Tester (qa-tester)
8. Documentation and Task Management
   - Technical Writer (technical-writer)
   - Task Decomposer (task-decomposer)

def process_repo(repo_path, format):
    click.echo(f"Processing repository: {repo_path}")
    click.echo(f"Output format: {format}")
    # Add processing logic here

    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v2

        python-version: '3.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    - name: Run tests
      run: python -m unittest discover tests
#+END_SRC

from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base

Base = declarative_base()

class Repository(Base):
    __tablename__ = 'repositories'

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name = Column(String)
    path = Column(String)
    last_processed = Column(DateTime)

            open(os.path.join(tmpdirname, 'subdir', 'file2.txt'), 'w').close()

            # Get the list of files
            files = list(traverse_directory(tmpdirname))

            # Check if all files are found
            self.assertEqual(len(files), 2)
            self.assertIn(os.path.join(tmpdirname, 'file1.txt'), files)

* Conclusion

This coordination plan leverages the specialized skills of each AI team member to efficiently develop the CodeNexus project. By breaking down the project into clear phases and establishing a robust communication structure, we aim to ensure smooth development and timely delivery of the tool.

The Project Manager and Code Architect will play crucial roles in maintaining overall project coherence, while specialized AI agents will contribute their expertise to their respective areas. Regular check-ins and clear communication channels will help identify and resolve issues quickly.

As the project progresses, we will continuously refine our coordination strategies based on team feedback and project needs. The unique nature of an all-AI team presents both opportunities and challenges, which we will address and optimize throughout the development process.
