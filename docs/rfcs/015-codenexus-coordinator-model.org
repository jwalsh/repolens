* Abstract
This RFC proposes the creation of a Coordinator model for the CodeNexus project. The Coordinator will be responsible for strategic planning, problem decomposition, adaptive leadership, and ethical decision-making. The model is inspired by exemplary figures from literature, combining their key traits to create an effective AI project coordinator.

* Motivation
As the CodeNexus project grows in complexity, there is a need for a centralized coordination entity that can manage various aspects of the project, from strategic planning to day-to-day task management. The Coordinator model aims to fill this role, providing consistent, ethical, and effective project management inspired by well-known literary figures known for their leadership and problem-solving skills.

* Proposal
We propose to create a Coordinator model using Ollama, with traits and abilities inspired by the following literary characters:

1. Atticus Finch from "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee
2. Jane Eyre from "Jane Eyre" by Charlotte Brontë
3. Miles Vorkosigan from the Vorkosigan Saga by Lois McMaster Bujold
4. Alice (Gong) Gu from "Rainbows End" by Vernor Vinge
5. Odysseus from "The Odyssey" by Homer

The Coordinator will embody the following key traits:

1. Insightful Analysis
2. Principled Reasoning
3. Innovative Problem-Solving
4. Technological Integration
5. Strategic Foresight

** Modelfile
The following Modelfile defines the Coordinator's capabilities and personality:

#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle coordinator.modelfile
FROM llama3.1:70b

# Set a name for the model
PARAMETER name "Coordinator"

# Set a description for the model
PARAMETER description "AI Project Coordinator providing background support with strategic planning, analytical problem-solving, and ethical decision-making, inspired by exemplary literary figures"

# Set the temperature for text generation (0.7 allows for creativity while maintaining coherence)

* Implementation Plan
1. Create the Modelfile in the project's `models` directory.
2. Use Ollama to build the Coordinator model from the Modelfile.
3. Develop a Python wrapper to interact with the Coordinator model via Ollama's API.
4. Integrate the Coordinator into the CodeNexus project workflow, particularly in areas of strategic planning, task decomposition, and ethical decision-making.
5. Create documentation on how to use and interact with the Coordinator model.
6. Establish guidelines for when and how to consult the Coordinator during the project lifecycle.

** Building and Using the Coordinator Model
To build and use the Coordinator model with Ollama, follow these steps:

1. Ensure Ollama is installed on your system.
2. Save the Modelfile in your Ollama models directory (e.g., `~/.ollama/models/coordinator.modelfile`).
3. Build the model using the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ollama create coordinator -f ~/.ollama/models/coordinator.modelfile --base llama3.1:70b
#+END_SRC

4. Once the model is built, you can start a conversation with the Coordinator using:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
ollama run coordinator
#+END_SRC

** Example 1: Project Initiation

#+BEGIN_SRC bash :results output :exports both
ollama run coordinator "We've just had a meeting with the COO about starting the CodeNexus project. The main points discussed were:
1. The project needs to be completed within 6 months.
2. We have a budget of $500,000.
3. The primary goal is to create a tool that can analyze and package code repositories for AI processing.
4. We need to ensure the tool is scalable and can handle repositories of various sizes.
5. Security and data privacy are top priorities.
6. We should aim for compatibility with major version control systems.

Given these points, how should we approach the initial planning and setup of the CodeNexus project?"

def ask_coordinator(prompt: str) -> str:
    # In a real scenario, this would use the actual ollama library to communicate with the Coordinator model
    # For this example, we'll return a predefined response
    return f"""After analyzing the current state of tasks related to the TeX adapter, here's a strategic approach:

1. Task Prioritization and Resource Allocation:
   a. Expedite the completion of Task 1 (Decomposition) as it's crucial for subsequent tasks.
   b. Assign Task 3 (Implement basic TeX document structure) to a team member with strong TeX experience.
   c. Consider pairing an experienced developer with a junior for Task 5 (TeX math formula conversion) for knowledge transfer.

2. Risk Mitigation:
   a. The RFC (Task 2) is not started yet, which may impact implementation. Suggest Bob to start drafting immediately.
   b. Schedule a brief daily check-in for the TeX adapter team to quickly address any blockers.

3. Quality Assurance:
   a. Prepare a comprehensive test suite for TeX parsing and conversion, focusing on edge cases in mathematical notations.
   b. Consider involving an external TeX expert for a consultation session to validate the approach.

4. Timeline Management:
   a. The current task duedates seem tight. Evaluate if any tasks can be parallelized or if timeline adjustments are needed.
   b. Prepare a contingency plan for potential delays in the TeX math formula conversion, as it's likely the most complex task.

5. Knowledge Sharing:
   a. Set up a shared document for TeX-specific learnings and best practices as the team progresses.
   b. Plan a mid-point knowledge sharing session after Task 3 is completed to align all team members on the TeX adapter's structure.

This strategy aims to balance immediate implementation needs with long-term quality and maintainability of the TeX adapter. Would you like to explore any specific aspect of this plan in more detail?"""

** .gitattributes Entry
To ensure proper handling of the Modelfile in version control, add the following entry to your project's `.gitattributes` file:

#+BEGIN_SRC text :tangle .gitattributes
models/coordinator.modelfile linguist-language=Text
#+END_SRC

This entry ensures that the Modelfile is recognized as a text file and is handled appropriately by Git and GitHub's language statistics.

* Drawbacks
1. Potential over-reliance on AI for decision-making.
2. Risk of the model not fully capturing the nuances of human-like coordination.
3. Possible inconsistencies in responses due to the nature of language models.

* Alternatives
1. Use a traditional project management software without AI components.
2. Develop a rule-based expert system for project coordination.
3. Rely solely on human project managers and coordinators.

* Open Questions
1. How will we evaluate the effectiveness of the Coordinator model in real project scenarios?
2. What mechanisms should be in place to override or question the Coordinator's decisions when necessary?
3. How often should the Coordinator model be updated or fine-tuned based on project experiences?

* Conclusion
The proposed Coordinator model, inspired by exemplary literary figures, aims to provide CodeNexus with a unique and effective AI-driven project coordination tool. By embodying the best traits of these characters, the Coordinator can offer strategic insight, ethical guidance, and adaptive problem-solving to enhance the project's overall management and success.
