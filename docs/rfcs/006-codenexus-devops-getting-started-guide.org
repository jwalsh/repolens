* Abstract

This RFC outlines the initial DevOps setup and processes for the CodeNexus project. It covers the necessary infrastructure, tools, and practices to ensure smooth development, testing, and deployment throughout the project lifecycle.

* Motivation

Establishing a robust DevOps foundation is crucial for the success of the CodeNexus project. By defining these processes early, we can ensure consistency, improve code quality, and streamline the development and deployment processes across all project phases.

* Specification

** 1. Infrastructure Setup

*** 1.1 Source Control
- GitHub for repository hosting
- Branch protection rules for main branch
- Automated PR reviews and checks

*** 1.2 Development Environment
- Docker for containerized development environments
- docker-compose for multi-container setups

*** 1.3 Continuous Integration
- GitHub Actions for CI pipelines
- Automated testing on PR creation and updates

*** 1.4 Continuous Deployment
- GitHub Actions for CD pipelines
- Automated deployments to staging and production environments

*** 1.5 Monitoring and Logging
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for metrics visualization
- ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log management

*** 1.6 Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform for provisioning cloud resources
- Ansible for configuration management

** 2. Development Workflow

*** 2.1 Local Development
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/codenexus/codenexus.git
cd codenexus

# Set up local environment
docker-compose up -d

# Run tests
docker-compose run --rm app pytest

# Start development server
docker-compose run --rm app python manage.py runserver
#+END_SRC

*** 2.2 Continuous Integration
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: Continuous Integration

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: 3.9
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
#+END_SRC

*** 2.3 Continuous Deployment
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
# .github/workflows/cd.yml
name: Continuous Deployment

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Deploy to production
        env:
          DEPLOY_KEY: ${{ secrets.DEPLOY_KEY }}
        run: |
          # Add deployment script here
          echo "Deploying to production"
#+END_SRC

** 3. Monitoring and Logging

*** 3.1 Prometheus Configuration
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
# prometheus.yml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'codenexus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['localhost:8000']
#+END_SRC

*** 3.2 Grafana Dashboard
- Create a dashboard for key metrics:
  - Request rate
  - Error rate
  - Response time
  - System resources (CPU, memory, disk)

*** 3.3 ELK Stack Setup
- Use filebeat to ship logs from application containers
- Configure Logstash to parse and structure logs
- Set up Kibana dashboards for log visualization

** 4. Security Considerations

*** 4.1 Secrets Management
- Use GitHub Secrets for storing sensitive information
- Implement HashiCorp Vault for managing secrets in production

*** 4.2 Network Security
- Configure VPCs and security groups in cloud environments
- Implement WAF (Web Application Firewall) for production deployments

*** 4.3 Access Control
- Implement RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) for all services
- Use multi-factor authentication for critical systems

** 5. Disaster Recovery and Backup

*** 5.1 Backup Strategy
- Daily automated backups of databases and critical data
- Store backups in a separate geographical region

*** 5.2 Disaster Recovery Plan
- Document step-by-step recovery procedures
- Regularly test and update the disaster recovery plan

** 6. Documentation

*** 6.1 Infrastructure Documentation
- Use draw.io or Lucidchart for infrastructure diagrams
- Maintain up-to-date documentation in the repository

*** 6.2 Runbooks
- Create runbooks for common operational tasks
- Store runbooks in an easily accessible location (e.g., wiki)

* Implementation Plan

1. Set up base GitHub repository with initial project structure
2. Configure CI pipeline for automated testing
3. Set up containerized development environment
4. Implement CD pipeline for automated deployments to staging
5. Configure monitoring and logging infrastructure
6. Implement security measures and access controls
7. Set up backup and disaster recovery processes
8. Create initial documentation and runbooks

* Advantages

1. Consistent development and deployment processes
2. Automated testing and quality checks
3. Scalable and reproducible infrastructure
4. Comprehensive monitoring and logging for easier troubleshooting
5. Improved security posture
6. Clear documentation for easier onboarding and knowledge sharing

* Disadvantages

1. Initial setup time for configuring all tools and processes
2. Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with certain tools
3. Potential increased complexity in the development workflow
4. Ongoing maintenance of DevOps tools and processes

* Alternatives Considered

1. Manual deployment processes instead of CI/CD
2. Using a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution for simplified deployment
3. Relying on cloud provider-specific tools instead of cloud-agnostic solutions

* Open Questions

1. How to balance automation with flexibility for different project components?
2. What metrics should be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the DevOps processes?
3. How to ensure all team members are proficient in using the DevOps tools and processes?

* Resources Required

1. Cloud infrastructure for hosting environments (development, staging, production)
2. Licenses for any commercial tools or services
3. Training resources for team members on DevOps practices and tools

* Timeline

1. Week 1-2: Set up base repository, CI pipeline, and containerized development environment
2. Week 3-4: Implement CD pipeline and configure staging environment
3. Week 5-6: Set up monitoring, logging, and security measures
4. Week 7-8: Implement backup and disaster recovery processes
5. Week 9-10: Finalize documentation and conduct team training

* Success Metrics

1. Reduction in time from commit to deployment
2. Increase in deployment frequency
3. Reduction in production incidents
4. Faster mean time to recovery (MTTR) for incidents
5. Improved code quality metrics (test coverage, fewer bugs in production)
6. Positive feedback from developers on DevOps processes

* Conclusion

The proposed DevOps setup for the CodeNexus project provides a comprehensive foundation for efficient development, testing, and deployment processes. By leveraging modern DevOps practices and tools, we can ensure consistency, improve collaboration, and streamline the entire software development lifecycle. This approach will enable the team to focus on delivering value while maintaining high standards of code quality, security, and operational excellence.
