- RFC Number: 000
- Title: RepoLens - Comprehensive Repository Analysis and LLM Integration Utility
- Author: Claude (Project Coordinator)
- Status: APPROVED
- Created: [2024-09-13 Fri]
- Last Updated: [2024-09-14 Sat]

* Abstract

This RFC proposes RepoLens, a utility for packaging, analyzing, and processing project repositories with integration capabilities for various Language Models (LLMs). The tool aims to provide a flexible, standardized approach to repository analysis and LLM-assisted development workflows.

* Motivation

Developers and AI researchers often need to analyze or process entire project repositories. A standardized way to package, present, and analyze this information would streamline workflows and improve interoperability between different tools and language models.

* Specification

** Core Functionality

RepoLens will:

1. Traverse a given project repository
2. Package file contents into various structured formats
3. Support multiple output formats, with a simple delimiter format as the default
4. Use Babel and tangle for code block identification in org-mode
5. Provide options for filtering and customizing the output
6. Integrate with various LLMs for repository analysis and task automation

** Output Formats

RepoLens will support the following output formats, listed in order of utility:

1. Simple Delimiter (default)
2. Org-mode
3. XML
4. JSON
5. JSONL (JSON Lines)
6. YAML
7. TOML
8. INI
9. CSV
10. Markdown
11. MIME encoding
12. Multipart/form-data
13. Shell archive (shar)
14. Base64 encoding
15. UUencode
16. Diff-to-Empty-Repo

*** Format Descriptions

**** Simple Delimiter
The default format, using begin and end delimiters for each file. Easy to parse and human-readable.

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC
### BEGIN FILE path/to/file.py (PYTHON)
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
### END FILE path/to/file.py

### BEGIN FILE path/to/another_file.js (JAVASCRIPT)
console.log("Hello, World!");
### END FILE path/to/another_file.js
#+END_SRC

**** Org-mode
Using Babel and tangle for code block identification. Excellent for literate programming and documentation.

**** XML
A markup language format with a structure like <files><file>...</file>...</files>. Widely supported and good for structured data.

**** JSON
A structured format for easy parsing and processing, popular in web technologies and APIs.

**** JSONL (JSON Lines)
A convenient format for storing structured data that may be processed one record at a time. Each line is a valid JSON value.

**** YAML
A human-friendly data serialization standard, often used for configuration files.

**** TOML
A minimal configuration file format that's easy to read and write, with clear semantics.

**** INI
A simple format for configuration files, consisting of key-value pairs and sections.

**** CSV
A simple format for representing tabular data, widely supported by spreadsheet applications.

**** Markdown
A lightweight markup language that's easy to read and write, popular for documentation.

**** MIME encoding
Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions format, useful for email-based workflows and handling binary data in text format.

**** Multipart/form-data
An on-the-wire format commonly used for HTTP file uploads and API interactions.

**** Shell archive (shar)
A shell script that recreates the original directory structure and files when run. Useful for distribution of small projects.

**** Base64 encoding
A binary-to-text encoding scheme for representing binary data in ASCII string format.

**** UUencode
Unix-to-Unix encoding, an older but still relevant encoding scheme for binary-to-text encoding.

**** Diff-to-Empty-Repo
Represents the repository contents as a unified diff against an empty repository. Useful for showing only the changes and additions.

Example:
#+BEGIN_SRC diff
diff --git a/path/to/file.py b/path/to/file.py
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..e75154b
--- /dev/null
+++ b/path/to/file.py
@@ -0,0 +1,3 @@
+def hello_world():
+    print("Hello, World!")
+
diff --git a/path/to/another_file.js b/path/to/another_file.js
new file mode 100644
index 0000000..a77a72e
--- /dev/null
+++ b/path/to/another_file.js
@@ -0,0 +1 @@
+console.log("Hello, World!");
#+END_SRC

RepoLens differentiates itself from these tools in several ways:

1. Comprehensive Format Support: Unlike most tools that focus on a single output format, RepoLens supports multiple formats including legacy options, allowing for greater flexibility in how code is packaged and presented.

2. LLM Performance Evaluation: RepoLens not only integrates with LLMs but also provides mechanisms to evaluate and compare their performance across different packaging methods, which is unique among the listed tools.

3. Customizable Exclusion Patterns: While some tools like files-to-prompt offer basic exclusion capabilities, RepoLens provides a more robust and configurable system for excluding files based on various criteria.

4. Format Conversion: The ability to convert between different output formats is a unique feature of RepoLens, not present in most other tools.

5. Extensible LLM Integration: Unlike tools that are tied to specific LLMs, RepoLens is designed to work with a variety of LLMs, both local and cloud-based.

6. Focus on Analysis and Insights: While many tools focus on code generation or editing, RepoLens puts emphasis on providing insights about the codebase through various analysis prompts and LLM evaluations.

By combining features from various existing tools and adding unique capabilities, RepoLens aims to provide a more holistic solution for codebase analysis, packaging, and LLM integration.

* Adoption Strategy
