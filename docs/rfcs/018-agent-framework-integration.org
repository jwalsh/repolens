* Abstract

This RFC proposes the integration of the RepoLens Coordinator model with various agent frameworks, with a primary focus on AWS Bedrock Agents. It outlines the implementation strategies for different frameworks and provides code examples to illustrate the integration process.

* Motivation

The RepoLens Coordinator model, as described in RFC 015, provides valuable project coordination capabilities. To maximize its utility and flexibility, we need to integrate it with various agent frameworks. This integration will allow the Coordinator to be used in different environments and with different tools, enhancing its applicability and value to the RepoLens project.

* Specification

** 1. AWS Bedrock Agents Integration

AWS Bedrock Agents offer a scalable and flexible solution for deploying AI agents. Here's an example of how we could integrate our Coordinator model with AWS Bedrock Agents:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
import boto3
import json

class CoordinatorAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.bedrock_runtime = boto3.client('bedrock-runtime')
        self.model_id = 'anthropic.claude-v2'  # Assuming we're using Claude v2

    def invoke_coordinator(self, prompt):
        body = json.dumps({
            "prompt": prompt,
            "max_tokens_to_sample": 2000,
            "temperature": 0.7,
            "top_p": 1,
            "top_k": 250,
            "stop_sequences": [],
        })

        response = self.bedrock_runtime.invoke_model(
            body=body,
            modelId=self.model_id,
            accept='application/json',
            contentType='application/json'
        )

        response_body = json.loads(response['body'].read())
        return response_body['completion']

    def get_project_advice(self, project_state):
        prompt = f"""As the RepoLens Coordinator, analyze the following project state and provide strategic advice:

{project_state}

Provide a detailed analysis and recommendations."""

        return self.invoke_coordinator(prompt)

# Usage
coordinator = CoordinatorAgent()
project_state = "We're implementing a new feature for code analysis, but we're behind schedule..."
advice = coordinator.get_project_advice(project_state)
print(advice)
#+END_SRC

** 2. Integration with Other Frameworks

*** LangChain

LangChain provides a flexible framework for building applications with LLMs. Here's a brief example of how we could integrate our Coordinator:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from langchain import PromptTemplate, LLMChain
from langchain.llms import Bedrock

template = """As the RepoLens Coordinator, analyze the following project state and provide strategic advice:

{project_state}

Provide a detailed analysis and recommendations."""

prompt = PromptTemplate(template=template, input_variables=["project_state"])
llm = Bedrock(model_id="anthropic.claude-v2")
coordinator_chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

# Usage
response = coordinator_chain.run("We're implementing a new feature for code analysis, but we're behind schedule...")
print(response)
#+END_SRC

*** AutoGPT

While AutoGPT is more focused on autonomous task completion, we could potentially use it to create a more autonomous version of our Coordinator:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from autogpt import AutoGPT
from autogpt.config import Config

config = Config()
config.continuous_mode = False
config.speak_mode = False

coordinator_agent = AutoGPT(
    ai_name="RepoLens Coordinator",
    memory_type="local",
    config=config
)

# Usage
coordinator_agent.run("Analyze the project state: We're implementing a new feature for code analysis, but we're behind schedule...")
#+END_SRC

*** Microsoft Prompt Flow

Microsoft Prompt Flow allows for the creation of multi-step AI workflows:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from promptflow import tool, flow

@tool
def coordinator_analysis(project_state: str):
    # This would integrate with our Coordinator model
    return f"Analysis of: {project_state}"

with flow() as f:
    result = coordinator_analysis("We're implementing a new feature for code analysis, but we're behind schedule...")
    print(result)
#+END_SRC

*** OpenAI Assistants API

The OpenAI Assistants API provides a high-level interface for creating AI assistants:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

assistant = client.beta.assistants.create(
    name="RepoLens Coordinator",
    instructions="You are the RepoLens Coordinator...",
    model="gpt-4-turbo-preview"
)

thread = client.beta.threads.create()
message = client.beta.threads.messages.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    role="user",
    content="We're implementing a new feature for code analysis, but we're behind schedule..."
)

run = client.beta.threads.runs.create(
    thread_id=thread.id,
    assistant_id=assistant.id
)

# Retrieve and process the response
#+END_SRC

*** Hugging Face Transformers Agent

Hugging Face provides a flexible framework for working with transformer models:

#+BEGIN_SRC python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer, pipeline

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("anthropic/claude-v2")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("anthropic/claude-v2")

coordinator = pipeline("text-generation", model=model, tokenizer=tokenizer)

response = coordinator("As the RepoLens Coordinator, analyze this project state: We're implementing a new feature for code analysis, but we're behind schedule...")
print(response[0]['generated_text'])
#+END_SRC

* Implementation Plan

1. Set up AWS Bedrock environment and implement the CoordinatorAgent class (2 weeks)
2. Develop integration tests for AWS Bedrock implementation (1 week)
3. Create proof-of-concept integrations for other frameworks (3 weeks)
4. Evaluate performance and usability of different integrations (1 week)
5. Finalize primary integration method and document usage (1 week)
6. Develop user guide for interacting with the Coordinator through chosen framework (1 week)

Total estimated time: 9 weeks

* Advantages

1. Flexibility to use the Coordinator in various environments and with different tools
2. Leveraging cloud-based solutions for scalability and performance
3. Ability to compare and choose the most suitable framework for our specific needs
4. Potential for expanded functionality through framework-specific features

* Challenges and Mitigation Strategies

1. Challenge: Maintaining consistency across different frameworks
   Mitigation: Develop a core Coordinator logic that can be adapted to each framework

2. Challenge: Managing dependencies and versioning for multiple frameworks
   Mitigation: Use virtual environments and clear dependency management in our project

3. Challenge: Ensuring security across different cloud platforms
   Mitigation: Implement robust security practices and regular audits for each integration

* Alternatives Considered

1. Focusing solely on AWS Bedrock Agents: Would limit flexibility but simplify development
2. Developing a custom framework: Would provide maximum control but require significant development time
3. Using a single, general-purpose framework like LangChain: May not leverage specific strengths of specialized frameworks

* Success Metrics

1. Successful integration with at least three different frameworks
2. Consistent Coordinator behavior across different integrations
3. Performance benchmarks showing acceptable latency and throughput
4. Positive feedback from development team on ease of use and flexibility

* Conclusion

Integrating the RepoLens Coordinator with various agent frameworks, particularly AWS Bedrock Agents, will significantly enhance its flexibility and utility. While the implementation presents some challenges, the benefits of being able to deploy our Coordinator in various environments and leverage different framework strengths make this a valuable addition to our project.
