* Abstract

This RFC outlines the tooling requirements and development workflow for the CodeNexus project. It covers the necessary tools, frameworks, and practices to ensure high-quality, maintainable, and extensible code throughout the project lifecycle.

* Motivation

Establishing a robust tooling ecosystem and development workflow is crucial for the success of the CodeNexus project. By defining these elements early, we can ensure consistency, improve code quality, and streamline the development process across all team members and project phases.

* Specification

** 1. Development Environment

*** 1.1 Version Control
- Git for version control
- GitHub for repository hosting and collaboration

*** 1.2 IDE/Editor
- VS Code as the recommended editor
- Extensions:
  - Python
  - Pylance
  - GitLens
  - Docker
  - YAML

*** 1.3 Virtual Environment
- Use `pyenv` for Python version management
- `poetry` for dependency management and packaging

** 2. Code Quality Tools

*** 2.1 Linting
- `flake8` for Python linting
- `eslint` for JavaScript/TypeScript linting

*** 2.2 Formatting
- `black` for Python code formatting
- `prettier` for JavaScript/TypeScript formatting

*** 2.3 Type Checking
- `mypy` for Python static type checking

*** 2.4 Security Scanning
- `bandit` for Python security vulnerability scanning

** 3. Testing Framework

*** 3.1 Unit Testing
- `pytest` for Python unit testing

*** 3.2 Integration Testing
- `pytest` with appropriate fixtures for integration tests

*** 3.3 End-to-End Testing
- `playwright` for browser-based end-to-end testing

*** 3.4 Code Coverage
- `coverage.py` for measuring code coverage

** 4. Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

*** 4.1 CI Pipeline
- GitHub Actions for automated testing and linting

*** 4.2 CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions for automated deployment to staging and production environments

** 5. Documentation

*** 5.1 API Documentation
- `sphinx` for generating API documentation from docstrings

*** 5.2 User Documentation
- `mkdocs` for user-facing documentation

*** 5.3 Architecture Documentation
- `C4 model` for system architecture documentation

** 6. Monitoring and Logging

*** 6.1 Application Monitoring
- `prometheus` for metrics collection
- `grafana` for metrics visualization

*** 6.2 Logging
- `structlog` for structured logging in Python

** 7. Containerization and Orchestration

*** 7.1 Containerization
- Docker for creating container images

*** 7.2 Orchestration
- Kubernetes for container orchestration in production

** 8. Data Serialization and Storage

*** 8.1 Serialization Formats
- JSON for API responses and configuration files
- Protocol Buffers for efficient data serialization

*** 8.2 Databases
- PostgreSQL for relational data storage
- Redis for caching and message queuing

** 9. Development Workflow

*** 9.1 Branching Strategy
- GitHub Flow (feature branches + main branch)

*** 9.2 Code Review Process
- Pull Requests (PRs) for all changes
- Required approvals from at least one team member
- Automated checks (linting, tests) must pass before merging

*** 9.3 Release Process
- Semantic Versioning for release numbering
- Automated changelog generation

*** 9.4 Issue Tracking
- GitHub Issues for bug tracking and feature requests
- Use of labels and milestones for organization

* Implementation Plan

1. Set up base repository with initial project structure
2. Configure linting and formatting tools with pre-commit hooks
3. Implement CI pipeline for automated testing and linting
4. Set up documentation generation tools and initial structure
5. Configure containerization for development and production environments
6. Implement CD pipeline for automated deployments
7. Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure
8. Create developer guidelines and documentation for tooling usage

* Advantages

1. Consistent development environment across the team
2. Automated code quality checks to maintain high standards
3. Comprehensive testing strategy to catch bugs early
4. Streamlined deployment process through CI/CD
5. Clear documentation practices for better knowledge sharing
6. Scalable infrastructure through containerization and orchestration

* Disadvantages

1. Initial setup time for configuring all tools
2. Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with certain tools
3. Potential over-reliance on tools without understanding underlying principles
4. Maintenance overhead for keeping all tools and configurations up to date

* Alternatives Considered

1. Using a monolithic framework instead of a modular approach
2. Manual quality checks and deployments instead of automation
3. Single language/ecosystem instead of polyglot approach

* Open Questions

1. How to balance standardization with flexibility for different project components?
2. What metrics should be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the tooling choices?
3. How to ensure all team members are proficient in using the chosen tools?

* Resources Required

1. Developer time for tool setup and configuration
2. Cloud infrastructure for CI/CD pipelines and deployments
3. Licenses for any commercial tools or services
4. Training resources for team members on new tools or practices

* Timeline

1. Week 1-2: Set up base repository and core development tools
2. Week 3-4: Implement CI pipeline and documentation generation
3. Week 5-6: Set up containerization and CD pipeline
4. Week 7-8: Configure monitoring, logging, and production infrastructure
5. Week 9-10: Finalize developer guidelines and conduct team training

* Success Metrics

1. Reduction in time spent on manual tasks (e.g., formatting, deployments)
2. Increase in code quality metrics (test coverage, fewer bugs in production)
3. Faster onboarding time for new team members
4. Reduction in deployment-related issues
5. Positive feedback from developers on tooling effectiveness

* Conclusion

The proposed tooling and development workflow for the CodeNexus project provides a comprehensive foundation for building high-quality, maintainable software. By leveraging modern development practices and tools, we can ensure consistency, improve collaboration, and streamline the development process. This approach will enable the team to focus on delivering value while maintaining high standards of code quality and project management.
